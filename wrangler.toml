# Routes commented out - using Pages Functions (_worker.js) instead
# This avoids Worker/Pages conflicts and simplifies deployment
# routes = [
#   { pattern = "sa1l.cc/*", zone_name = "sa1l.cc" }
# ]

# For pages.dev preview domain:
# Add _worker.js symlink to your Pages project pointing to static-site-worker.js
# The _worker.js file will handle both sa1l.cc and pages.dev domains via Pages Functions
