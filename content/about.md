# About SA1L.CC

# SA1L.CC — Flexible QR Codes You Can Change Anytime

**SA1L.CC** is a simple, practical tool for creating QR codes that don’t lock you into a single destination forever. You create a QR code once, and you can change where it sends people at any time — no reprinting, no redesigning, no stress.

Whether you’re working on printed materials, packaging, posters, business cards, or prototypes, SA1L.CC lets you move fast without committing too early to a final website or landing page.

## Get Started

Ready to create your first QR code? [go to the generator](/) or [see all your qr codes](/dashboard.html) if you're already logged in.

## What is SA1L.CC?

SA1L.CC is a web-based QR code generator with editable destinations.

Instead of generating a QR code that points directly to a final URL, SA1L.CC creates a QR code that points to a **shortened SA1L.CC link**. That link then **redirects** visitors to the destination you choose.

Because the QR code always points to SA1L.CC, you can update the destination whenever you want — even after the QR code has been printed, shared, or distributed.

There’s no monthly fee. The site is lightweight, intentionally simple, and supported by ads, sponsorship, and optional user support.

## Why SA1L.CC Exists

QR codes are everywhere — but most of them are fragile.

Once a traditional QR code is generated, it’s permanently tied to a single URL. If that URL changes, breaks, or needs replacing, the QR code becomes useless.

SA1L.CC solves this by acting as a **stable middle layer** between your QR code and your final destination.

That means you can:

- Design printed materials before your website is finished  
- Change landing pages without reprinting QR codes  
- Fix mistakes instantly  
- Reuse the same QR code for different campaigns over time  

If you’ve ever thought *“I wish I could just update where this QR code goes”*, that’s exactly what SA1L.CC is for.

## How Does SA1L.CC Work?

1. You log in to SA1L.CC  
2. You create a QR code  
3. The QR code points to a shortened SA1L.CC URL  
4. SA1L.CC redirects visitors to your chosen destination  
5. You can update that destination at any time  

### Step-by-step

**1. Log in**  
Currently, SA1L.CC supports authentication using:
- Google  
- GitHub  

No passwords to remember, and no complicated setup.

**2. Create a QR code**  
Enter the destination URL you want the QR code to send people to (for example, a website, landing page, form, or document).

**3. Share or print your QR code**  
You can now safely use that QR code anywhere — online or offline.

**4. Change the destination later**  
At any point, go to **“See all my QR codes”**, select the QR code, and update its destination. The QR code itself stays the same.

## How Is This Different From a Normal QR Code?

A traditional QR code works like this:

- QR code -> final website URL  

With SA1L.CC, it works like this:

- QR code -> SA1L.CC short link -> your website URL  

SA1L.CC's short link makes your QR code easier to scan and your destination flexible.

## What Is a QR Code?

A **QR code** (Quick Response code) is a type of two-dimensional barcode that can store information such as a URL, text, or contact details.

When scanned with a phone camera or QR scanner, the code instantly opens the stored link or content.

QR codes are widely used for:
- Websites and landing pages  
- Menus and booking systems  
- Payments and forms  
- Product packaging  
- Events and marketing materials  

They’re fast, familiar, and work across nearly all modern smartphones.

---

## What Is a Redirect?

A **redirect** is when a web address automatically sends a visitor to another address.

For example:
- A visitor opens `sa1l.cc/abcd`
- SA1L.CC immediately forwards them to `https://yourwebsite.com/page`

This happens in milliseconds and feels instant to the user.

Redirects are a standard part of how the web works and are widely used for:
- URL shortening  
- Campaign tracking  
- Site restructuring  
- Maintaining backwards compatibility  

SA1L.CC uses redirects so you stay in control of where your QR codes lead.

## How Many Times Can I Change My QR Code’s Destination?

As many times as you want.

There are no limits on how often you update a QR code’s destination. You can change it once, a hundred times, or never at all — it’s entirely up to you.

This makes SA1L.CC useful for:
- Iterating on landing pages  
- Running time-based campaigns  
- Fixing mistakes instantly  
- Reusing QR codes across projects  

---

## Can I Design Before My Website Is Ready?

Yes — and this is one of the main reasons people use SA1L.CC.

You can generate QR codes **before**:
- Your website is finished  
- Your final URL is decided  
- Your content is live  

Later, when everything is ready, you just update the destination.

This is especially useful for print runs, packaging, signage, and anything expensive or slow to change.

---

## How Does SA1L.CC Make Money?

SA1L.CC is intentionally lightweight and low-cost.

The site relies heavily on:
- Cloudflare’s free services  
- Google’s authentication system  
- Simple infrastructure  

Because of this, SA1L.CC does **not** charge a monthly subscription fee.

Instead, the site is supported through:
- Display and text ads
